# Dependencies Analysis Implementation

## Overview
The Dependencies Analysis component evaluates the relationships and dependencies of a Jira issue, identifying blockers, related issues, implicit dependencies mentioned in comments, and external dependencies like systems or teams. This analysis helps teams understand the complexity of an issue's dependencies and better manage the dependencies for smoother workflow.

## Implementation Approach

### Function Signature
We'll create a `getDependenciesAnalysis` function that takes a Jira issue and comments response as parameters:

```typescript
function getDependenciesAnalysis(issue: JiraIssue, commentsResponse: IssueCommentResponse): Dependencies
```

### Main Components

1. **Blockers Analysis**
   - Extract explicitly linked issues that are marked as blockers
   - Analyze the `issuelinks` array in the issue object, filtering for links with type "Blocks" or similar
   - For each blocker, extract key and summary
   - Consider status of blockers (resolved vs. unresolved)

2. **Related Issues Analysis**
   - Extract all linked issues that are not blockers
   - Identify relationship types (e.g., "relates to", "is cloned by", etc.)
   - Consider the relevance and impact of each relationship
   - Categorize by relationship type for better organization

3. **Implicit Dependencies Detection**
   - Analyze issue description and comments for mentions of dependencies not formally linked
   - Use pattern matching and natural language processing techniques to identify:
     - References to other issue keys (e.g., "depends on PROJ-123")
     - Phrases indicating dependencies (e.g., "blocked by", "waiting for", "depends on")
     - References to systems, teams, or individuals (e.g., "need input from auth team")
   - Consolidate and deduplicate findings

4. **External Dependencies Identification**
   - Identify references to external systems, teams, or approvals
   - Look for specific keywords indicating dependencies on:
     - External systems or APIs
     - Other teams or departments
     - Third-party services
     - Approvals or signoffs required
   - Analyze comments for mentions of external dependencies that may impact timeline

### Implementation Logic

1. **Extracting Explicit Links**
   - Navigate the issue's `issuelinks` array
   - Categorize links based on their type
   - For blockers, check if the issue is blocked by or is blocking other issues
   - For each link, extract necessary information (key, summary)

2. **Analyzing Comments for Implicit Dependencies**
   - Process each comment's body text
   - Use regex patterns to identify issue keys (e.g., `PROJECT-\d+`)
   - Look for dependency phrases ("blocked by", "depends on", "waiting for")
   - Extract mentioned dependencies not already included in explicit links
   - Consider the context of the mention to determine relevance

3. **Identifying External Dependencies**
   - Create a list of keywords for common external dependencies
   - Scan description and comments for mentions of these keywords
   - Analyze context to determine if they represent actual dependencies
   - Categorize findings by type (system, team, approval, etc.)
   
4. **Result Consolidation**
   - Deduplicate dependencies across all categories
   - Structure the results according to the defined interface
   - Ensure consistent formatting of dependency information

## Considerations for Implementation

### Testability
- Separate the logic for each type of dependency analysis into individual functions
- Use dependency injection to make external services mockable
- Create clear interfaces for the input and output data
- Add unit tests for each analysis function with various test cases

### Performance
- Consider caching results for large issues with many comments
- Implement batch processing for comments to avoid memory issues
- Use efficient regex patterns and avoid excessive string operations

### Maintainability
- Document all regex patterns and keywords used
- Create a configuration file for adjustable parameters
- Add detailed comments explaining the logic
- Consider making keyword lists and patterns extensible

### Edge Cases
- Handle issues with no links or dependencies
- Process comments with malformed issue references
- Manage cases where linked issues have been deleted
- Handle rate limiting when fetching additional issue details

## Integration with Existing System

The `getDependenciesAnalysis` function will be called from the main `analyzeIssue` function, similar to the existing analysis components:

```typescript
// In analyzeIssue.ts
const dependenciesAnalysis = getDependenciesAnalysis(issue, commentsResponse)

// Add to the result object
return {
  // ... existing properties
  dependencies: dependenciesAnalysis,
}
```

This implementation approach provides a comprehensive analysis of an issue's dependencies while maintaining consistency with the existing architecture and ensuring the component is testable and maintainable.
