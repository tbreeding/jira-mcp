# Jira Issue Creation Wizard: Implementation Priority Guide - (IGNORE)

This document outlines the prioritized implementation steps for the Jira Issue Creation Wizard, organized in the order they should be tackled from the current state. It focuses on creating a conversational, intuitive experience similar to a text-based RPG game, where users can naturally interact with the wizard and check their progress.

## Immediate Steps (Week 1)

### 1. Enhanced State Management Logging
1. Create structured logging framework for state transitions
2. Implement diagnostic logging for all MCP tool operations
3. Add context-rich error messages for each failure case
4. Create debug helper functions to trace state at each step
5. Add entry and exit logs for all state-changing functions
6. Implement MCP Inspector integration points for visualization

**Validation Criteria:**
- Developers can view detailed logs showing all state transitions
- Each error message includes context about the expected state vs. actual state
- The MCP Inspector shows a visual representation of state changes
- Log files contain entry/exit information for all state-modifying functions
- Failed operations include stack traces and state dumps for debugging
- We can reproduce and track the exact sequence of the "No active wizard found" error

### 2. State Initialization Redesign
1. Redesign initialization sequence to be more robust
2. Add explicit wizard creation step before state updates
3. Fix "No active wizard found" errors by improving initialization
4. Create clear state validation at each transition point
5. Implement proper error recovery for interrupted sessions
6. Test initialization with various edge cases

**Validation Criteria:**
- The "No active wizard found" error no longer occurs during normal operation
- Wizard initialization succeeds consistently across multiple attempts
- Each tool operation properly validates the wizard state before proceeding
- Invalid state transitions are prevented with clear error messages
- The initialization sequence is documented and easily traceable in logs
- Users can reliably start a new wizard session without errors

### 3. State Persistence Enhancement
1. Implement durable state storage mechanism
2. Add session identifiers for wizard instances
3. Create state migration for interrupted sessions
4. Implement periodic state backups during long operations
5. Add recovery mechanisms from serialized state
6. Test state persistence across different operation patterns

**Validation Criteria:**
- Wizard state persists reliably across function calls and sessions
- Interrupted sessions can be recovered without data loss
- Session identifiers properly distinguish between wizard instances
- State backups are created at key transition points
- Recovery mechanism works when sessions are interrupted
- Persistence doesn't noticeably impact performance

## Short-term Improvements (Weeks 2-3)

2. Implement resource provider for exposing current wizard state
3. Add real-time state updates via MCP resource subscriptions
4. Create UI helpers that consume wizard state resources
5. Implement resource templates for Jira entities (projects, issue types, fields)
6. Test resource-based state access patterns

**Validation Criteria:**
- The wizard state can be accessed using the `jira-wizard://state` URI
- Changes to the wizard state trigger resource update notifications

- Issue type selection includes clear explanations of each type
- Field completion prompts include examples and guidance
- Review prompts highlight potential improvements
- The entire flow feels guided and structured
- Prompts adapt based on previous selections

### 8. Improved Navigation and Flow
1. Implement "go back" functionality between wizard steps
2. Create "save point" functionality to preserve partial work
3. Add resume capabilities for interrupted sessions
4. Implement state visualization for complex processes
5. Create transition guidance between steps
6. Test navigation with various user workflows

**Validation Criteria:**
- Users can navigate backwards to previous steps with "go back" functionality

## New MCP Tool Definitions

To support the conversational experience, the following new tools should be implemented:

1. `issueCreation_checkProgress` - Get the current wizard progress in narrative form
2. `issueCreation_goBack` - Return to previous step in the wizard
3. `issueCreation_savePoint` - Create a named save point for the current state
4. `issueCreation_getHelp` - Get contextual help for the current wizard state

## Testing Strategy

### Immediate Testing Focus
- Verify state initialization works correctly in all scenarios
- Test state transitions with extensive logging enabled
- Validate error messages provide clear guidance
- Ensure state persistence works reliably
- Verify field validation handles all edge cases

### Secondary Testing Focus
- Test conversational flow with mock conversations
- Verify resource-based state access works correctly  
- Validate prompt-based interactions guide users effectively
- Test navigation between steps in various sequences
- Ensure RPG-style elements enhance the experience

## Overall Success Criteria

**The implementation will be considered successful when:**

1. The wizard consistently initializes without errors
2. Users can navigate through the wizard using natural language
3. The experience feels like a guided, conversational journey
4. Field validation prevents invalid submissions
5. Users receive helpful guidance throughout the process
6. The resulting issues follow best practices
7. The narrative elements enhance rather than distract
8. The wizard state persists reliably across operations

## Integration with Model Context Protocol

This implementation leverages two key MCP concepts:

1. **MCP Resources** - For exposing wizard state and Jira entities as addressable resources
2. **MCP Prompts** - For creating guided, conversational interaction templates

By combining these capabilities with enhanced state management and a conversational interface, the Jira Issue Creation Wizard will provide an intuitive, text-based RPG-like experience for creating well-structured Jira issues.
