 * Team Dependency Indicators for External Dependency Analysis
 *
 * This module provides a set of keywords and terms that indicate dependencies on
 * other teams or organizational units. These indicators are used to identify cross-team
 * dependencies in Jira issues by scanning issue text for mentions of teams, departments,
 * squads, and other organizational structures that may represent external dependencies.
