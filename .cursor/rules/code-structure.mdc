# Code Structure

- [MUST] No default exports, only named exports
- Organize by features/domains as top-level folders
- Write tests in adjacent __tests__ folders.
- Use consistent folder structure within features
- Group related files in a single directory
- Limit file size to maintain readability (max ~80 lines)
- One component/module per file
- Separate business logic from side effects like API calls or UI rendering
- Keep configuration separate from implementation
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Minimize the visibility scope of functions and variables
- Consider organizing files by their role in the application (services, utils, controllers, etc.)
- Keep directory nesting to a minimum (max 3-4 levels deep)
- Types should be relegated to "types" subfolders located in adjacent folders to their production code
- Follow the naming pattern `*.type.ts` for type files
- Interface names should not start with "I" prefix
