# General Principles

- Follow clean coding principles
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use errors as objects pattern, avoid throwing exceptions unless absolutely necessary
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - each function should do one thing well
- Follow Single Level of Abstraction Principle - operations within a function should be at the same level of abstraction
- Abstract compound conditions into separate, well-named functions
- Use pure functions whenever possible - no side effects, same output for same input
- Maintain immutability - avoid modifying data; create new copies instead
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Keep functions small and focused (under 15-20 lines)
- Use meaningful naming - functions should be verbs, variables should be nouns
- Avoid abbreviations - full names improve readability
- No magic numbers/strings - use named constants
