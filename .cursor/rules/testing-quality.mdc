- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Maintain test independence - tests should not depend on other tests
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Test behavior and outcomes, not internal structure
- To avoid unnecessarily long fixture with information irrelavant to the test, use casting "as unknown as ..."
